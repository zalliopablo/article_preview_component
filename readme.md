## Description

In this project, we can find a card type component in which we can see a title and a brief description of a decoration article.
Underneath, we can find an image and the name of the person who wrote the article. We can also find a button that will take us to the social networks of that person.

## Tecnology & Metodology

In this project we have used the three most used technologies in the design and development *Fontend* which are
**HTML**, **CSS**. and **JavaScript**.
We have used the concept *Mobile First*, which is used to adapt the design starting with the smallest devices and growing to the largest screens, this not only generates a better adaptability for different devices, but also generates a better positioning **SEO**.

It is used within the *HTML* layout the **BEM** methodology,
which is very popular in web development and is one of the most comfortable to work on any type of project.
